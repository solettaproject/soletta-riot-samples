This is, essentially, the same as the soletta-coap-server for
RIOT and Zephyr, except that targeted specifically for Contiki, where
there is no generic API for GPIO.

To build, two variables need to be exported for make to get them

CONTIKI = path to the Contiki source directory
SOLETTA_BASE_DIR = path to Soletta's source directory
